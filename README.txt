// Qcodo Drupal Module - QDrupal
//////////////////////////////////////

QDrupal is a Drupal Module that brings the capabilities of the QCodo
Framework into Drupal in a clean way.  

For more information about Qcodo, please visit http://www.qcodo.com
To learn why the author's of this module recommend using Zcodo
(http://www.zcodo.com) instead of Qcodo, please visit http://zcodo.com/

In short, the author of Qcodo was making contributions to the Qcodo core
difficult, so Zcodo is a "compatible" branch of the Qcodo framework.
