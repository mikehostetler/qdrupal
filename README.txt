// Qcubed Drupal Module - QDrupal
//////////////////////////////////////

QDrupal is a Drupal Module that brings the capabilities of the QCubed
Framework into Drupal in a clean way.  

For more information about Qcubed, please visit http://qcu.be
To learn why the author's of this module recommend using Qcubed
(http://www.qcu.be) instead of Qcubed, please visit http://qcu.be/

In short, the author of Qcubed was making contributions to the Qcubed core
difficult, so Qcubed is a "compatible" branch of the Qcubed framework.
