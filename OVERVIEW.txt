This is a quick and dirty overview of how the qdrupal module works.  It is mainly intended for developers.  Significant portions of this doc may be more up to date on the website.


Background
Qcubed is a lightweight php framework.  It is based substantially on another project: Qcodo.

Webpages using the Qcubed framework generally have two components.  A 'Qform' file which describes the logic of the page, how objects are loaded, what controls are present, what actions are executed, etc, and a 'template' file that describes any static html and specifies the layout of the controls.  

IN the MVC paradigm, the Qform is the 'Controller' and the template is the 'View'.  The 'Model' is an Object relation model provided by the framework.  

Qcubed can be pointed at a database, and the framework will automatically generate an object layer representing the rows and columns.  

Qcubed will also automatically generate a CRUD skeleton for each DB table.  This allows one to go very quickly from DB-> working web app with the click of a button.

The Qdrupal module is a lightweight layer sitting between drupal and the Qcubed framework.

The main features are:
- all capabilities of Qcubed are present
- you can specify more than one 'qdrupal application' via the drupal portal.  This allows seperate applications to have their own database settings, their own data objects and their own pages, or qdrupal_links (more on this later)
- A drupal area is created for each applicaiton to allow one to regenerate all the ORM code and rapid CRUD features of Qcubed
 
- A drupal area is created for each application with access to the draft forms created by the Qcubed codegeneration routine

- A new drupal node type called qdrupal_link is available.  This allows one to create a drupal node that points to a traditional Qcubed form.  The drupal node will have all the normal attributes controlled by drupal, like auto paths, menu items, taxonomy, permissions control etc.  The rendered content will appear in the normal drupal page format, so it can be themed as any pther page.
